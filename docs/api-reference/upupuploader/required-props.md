# Required Props

These props are required for the UpupUploader component to work.

| Prop                            | Example                                          | Type         | Status   | Default Value |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| [provider](#provider)           | `provider={UpupProvider.DigitalOcean}`           | UpupProvider | required | -             |
| [tokenEndpoint](#tokenendpoint) | `tokenEndpoint=http://localhost:3000/api/upload` | string       | required | -             |

## `provider`

This prop determines what cloud storage the selected files are uploaded to.

:::info
When using TypeScript, the provider must be one of the enum values from [UpupProvider](/docs/category/upupuploader) to avoid type errors:

```typescript
export enum UpupProvider {
  AWS = "aws",
  Azure = "azure",
  BackBlaze = "backblaze",
  DigitalOcean = "digitalocean",
}
```

The component will throw an error if you pass these values as a string.
:::

```typescript
throw new Error(`Invalid provider: ${this.config.provider}`);
```

Here is an example of using the Azure Provider:

```tsx
import { UpupUploader, UpupProvider } from "upup-react-file-uploader";

export default function Uploader() {
  return (
    <UpupUploader
      provider={UpupProvider.Azure} // assuming we are uploading to Azure
      tokenEndpoint="<path_to_your_server>" // Path to your server route that calls our exported upload utilities
    />
  );
}
```

## `tokenEndpoint`

This prop refers to the endpoint or route on your server that handles the file(s) upload POST request from the UpupUploader component. It must be passed with http or https included. For example: `http://localhost:8008/<your_route>`

The POST request sent for each file is of this this format:

```typescript
interface TokenRequest {
  name: string; // gotten from the name of the file: file.name
  type: string; // gotten from the type of the file: file.type
  size: number; // gotten from the size of the file: file.size
  provider: UpupProvider; // passed as `provider` prop in the `UpupUploader` component
  multiple?: boolean; // boolean value calculated as `limit > 1` -> limit is from the prop in the `UpupUploader` component
  accept?: string; // passed as a prop in the `UpupUploader` component
  maxFileSize?: number; // derived from the `maxFileSize` prop in the `UpupUploader` component
  customProps?: object; // passed as a prop in the `UpupUploader` component
}
```

And returns an array response for each file as follows:

```typescript
interface PresignedUrlResponse {
  uploadUrl: string;
  key: string;
}
```

:::note
Your server must configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to explicitly allow requests from your client application's origin. This is required because the browser blocks cross-origin requests by default.

Here's a basic Express server configuration example:

```javascript
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";

const app = express();

// Configure CORS middleware
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: process.env.CLIENT_ORIGIN || "http://localhost:3000", // Your client's origin
    methods: ["POST"], // Only allow required methods
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"], // Exact headers might vary based on your server setup
    credentials: true,
  })
);

// Your token endpoint handler
app.post("/api/upload-token", (req, res) => {
  // Handle upload logic here
});
```
