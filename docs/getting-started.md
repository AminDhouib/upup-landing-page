# Getting Started

Upup is an open-source, free-to-use **Full-stack library** that easily handles your file upload needs with seamless DigitalOcean Spaces, Amazon S3, Backblaze, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, Google Drive, and OneDrive integrations.

## Installation

Install upup with your favourite package manager

### npm

```bash
npm install @bassem97/upup
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add @bassem97/upup
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add @bassem97/upup
```

### bun

```bash
bun install @bassem97/upup
```

## Logic Diagram

This logic diagram explains how the client and server parts of the upup package works

sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client (UpupUploader)
    participant Server as Node.js Server
    participant Cloud as Cloud Storage (S3/Azure/etc)
    
    Client->>Server: POST to tokenEndpoint with file metadata
    Note right of Server: Uses s3GeneratePresignedUrl/azureGenerateSasUrl<br/>(src/index.node.ts:1-4)
    Server-->>Client: Returns presigned URL + upload key
    
    Client->>Cloud: PUT/POST file directly using presigned URL
    Cloud-->>Client: Upload confirmation
    
    loop Progress Updates
        Client->>Client: Track upload progress<br/>(useRootProvider.ts:199-222)
        Client-->>Client: Update filesProgressMap<br/>(src/frontend/hooks/useRootProvider.ts:203-210)
    end
    
    Client->>Server: Finalize upload (optional)
    Server-->>Client: Confirm storage metadata
    
    Note over Client,Cloud: Handles multiple adapters<br/>(Google Drive, OneDrive etc)<br/>via separate flows (useOneDriveUploader.ts:1-132)
```

## Usage

The example below shows a minimal configuration for AWS S3 upload, using the [UpupUploader](/docs/category/upupuploader) client component and the [`s3GeneratePresignedUrl`](/docs/api-reference/s3-generate-presigned-url.md) utility. For full code examples check these [docs](/docs/code-examples.md)

### Client Side

```tsx
import { UpupUploader, UpupProvider } from "@bassem97/upup";

export default function Uploader() {
  return (
    <UpupUploader
      provider={UpupProvider.AWS} // assuming we are uploading to AWS
      tokenEndpoint="http://<path_to_your_server>/api/upload-token" // Path to your server route that calls our exported upload utilities
    />
  );
}
```

:::note

The [`UpupUploader`](/docs/category/upupuploader) must be placed in a client component.

:::

Then use it in your application:

```tsx
import Uploader from "<path_to_your_uploader_component>";

export default function App() {
  return <Uploader />;
}
```

:::info

 [`provider`](/docs/api-reference/upupuploader/required-props.md#provider) and [`tokenEndpoint`](/docs/api-reference/upupuploader/required-props.md#tokenendpoint) are the only required props for the UpupUploader component. For a full list of component props, check out these [docs](/docs/category/upupuploader).

:::

### Server Side

```ts
import { s3GeneratePresignedUrl } from "@bassem97/upup/server";

app.post('/api/upload-token', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { provider, ...fileParams } = req.body; // The request body sent from the `UpupUploader` client component
    const origin = req.headers["origin"]; // The origin of your client application

    // Generate presigned URL
    const presignedData = await s3GeneratePresignedUrl({
      origin: origin as string,
      provider,
      fileParams,
      bucketName: process.env.AWS_BUCKET_NAME as string,
      s3ClientConfig: {
        region: process.env.AWS_REGION as string,
        credentials: {
          accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID as string,
          secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as string,
        },
      },
    });

    return res
      .status(200)
      .json({
        data: presignedData,
        message: "Upload successful!",
        error: false,
      });
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(500).json({
      message: (error as Error).message,
      error: true,
    });
  }
});
```

Once again, the example shown above is the minimal required configuration for AWS S3 upload. For uploading to other services see these [docs](/docs/code-examples.md)

### Important Note

It is important to note that while it is possible to:

- Implement your own custom logic on the client and use the server utilities provided by this component on the server OR
- Use the `UpupUploader` React component on the client and implement your own custom server logic to handle uploads,

For best performance and minimal overhead, we advise that you use both the [`UpupUploader`](/docs/category/upupuploader) React component together with the server utilities, like [`s3GeneratePresignedUrl`](/docs/api-reference/s3-generate-presigned-url.md)

The full list of exported server utility functions include:

- [`s3GeneratePresignedUrl`](/docs/api-reference/s3-generate-presigned-url.md): for S3-compatible Uploads: like AWS, Digital Ocean, Backblaze
- [`azureGenerateSasUrl`](/docs/api-reference/azure-generate-sas-url.md): for Azure Blob Uploads only

:::info

For a full list of values sent by the React component to the server, check out these [docs](/docs/api-reference/upupuploader/required-props.md#tokenendpoint).
